/**
 * Message-catalog parity test.
 *
 * The BSupervisor frontend has no standalone unit-test runner (only the
 * Playwright e2e suite), so the `supervisor.en.json` / `supervisor.ko.json`
 * parity assertion lives here as a plain Playwright spec. It does NOT open
 * a browser — it just imports both JSON catalogs and asserts:
 *
 *   1. Both files expose the identical key tree (no missing / extra keys).
 *   2. Every leaf value is a non-empty string.
 *
 * This guards against the classic i18n drift bug where a new key is added
 * to one locale but forgotten in the other.
